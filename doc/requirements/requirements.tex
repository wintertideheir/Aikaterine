\section{Introduction}

Virtuous Hummingbird is a program for the organization and advancement of personal virtue.
By virtue, we mean the virtues of virtue ethics, personal qualities indicating a pattern of repeated behavior.
These qualities are related causally to form a hierarchical tree of virtues. 
The simple nature of virtues and virtue trees makes virtue ethics an unusually intuitive and practical ethical theory.
By presenting a way to create, edit, visualize, and track these virtues, Virtuous Hummingbird facilitates living a virtuous life.

\section{Business Requirements}
\setreqtype{Business}{business}

\subsection{Prototyping}

\begin{requirement}[Prototyping \\ 1\textsuperscript{st} Priority]{1}
    Virtuous Hummingbird must prototype itself, i.e. it must demonstrate the feasability of applied virtue ethics so as to warrant further development and use.
\end{requirement}

Virtuous Hummingbird is similar to productivity programs, but differs in it's approach and philosophy.
Productivity programs rarely claim any association with ethics, and presume a motivation for productivity exists.
Their burden is consequently lower, as they only need to plan, organize, optimize an approach to a predetermined goal.
In constrast, an ethical approach must construct and justify the goal itself.

There are no true analogous programs to Virtuous Hummingbird, which indicates the risk that an ethical approach is unfeasable.
To warrant more development, we must show that a minimum set of features performs a certain set of functions.
These functions are the construction, justification, planning, organization, and optimization of simple virtue improvement.
By simple virtue improvement, we mean the improvement of a tree of virtues where the virtue of a parent is the linear combination of it's children's.
These virtues are measured by tests of virtue and by internal introspection.
This is the archetypical form of virtue that Aristotle explores in Nicomachean Ethics.

\subsection{Portfolio}

\begin{requirement}[Portfolio \\ 2\textsuperscript{nd} Priority]{2}
    Virtuous Hummingbird must serve as a programming portfolio piece, i.e. it must implement modern development practices and good project management.
\end{requirement}

Any program that seeks further development ought to be easy to develop.
Ease of development through familiarity can be created by using modern tooling and development practices.
However, the most recent tools and practices are often too unrefined to belong in a portfolio.
Furthermore, sequential/waterfall development and other widely considered outdated practices might better suit Virtuous Hummingbird.

To begin with, we have chosen
\begin{itemize}
    \item Java 8 for code
    \item Gradle for automation
    \item Git for version control
    \item Markdown and \LaTeX for documentation
\end{itemize}
These tools are modern enough to be familiar to most developers and refined enough to show personal ability.
For project management, we've turned to the waterfall model, which describes development as a sequence of stages with different responsibilities.
Although widely considered outdated, it enforces thorough documentation and prevents expensive errors from amplifying in later stages.
The skills it requires also apply to modern models like agile.

\subsection{Personal Improvement}

\begin{requirement}[Personal Improvement \\ 3\textsuperscript{rd} Priority]{3}
    Virtuous Hummingbird should show that it can be used to improve virtue through a scientific process.
\end{requirement}

Despite our intention to prototype Virtuous Hummingbird first, we should expect a number of new techniques for advancement of virtue.
Throughout the development process, we should note where a manual process would work better, and how to improve the software to match that performance.
We should also be continually testing new techniques \textit{in vivo}.
The final test should occur in the final testing stage, where we develop one set of virtues with Virtuous Hummingbird and develop another with standard productivity techniques as a control.

\section{Market Assessment}

\subsection{Target Demographic}

The target demographic is between 25 and 35 years of age.
This age group has the maturity to recognize the value of an ethical system, and enough time to reap the benefits of a full implementation.

The target demographic is male, because young men appear to take greater risks and have less of a sense of purpose in life.
The downsides of generally greater risk taking can be best mitigated by carefully selecting which risks have the highest return on investment, a task any ethical theory can help with.
Virtue ethics in particular favors long-term develop of the virtues, and therefore uniquely discourages short-term risk-taking.

The target demographic should also be educated, with at least some college, but preferably a bachelor's degree.
Virtue ethics works best when applied to a varied and numerous set of decisions, because their sheer potential complexity requires a deliberately simple approach.
College-educated users manage intellectually challenging classes and/or jobs, which therefore requires managing a varied and numerous set of decisions.

The target demographic is unmarried and without dependents, and preferably single.
As a consequence they will spend less time on relationships that will likely not benefit from ethical theory.

The target demographic values an individualistic approach to life and a Protestant work ethic.
Individualism is the principle that one ought to be independent and self-reliant, which encourages self-directed learning.
The Protestant work ethic is the belief that work, discipline, and frugality are a divine obligation.
A Protestant work ethic requires the hard work needed to make use of virtue ethics.

\subsection{Target Problem}

Our target demographic will likely have problems efficiently managing their time.
In many cases, a combination of a calendar, task-list, and time-tracker can help plan, prioritize, and track their activities.
As the the number and variety of activities increases, however, optimally prioritizing them becomes more difficult.
Virtue ethics can help this problem by offering a long-term, continuous, and simple method of organization.

First, these activities must be integrated into a tree of virtues.
A virtue is a trait with an associated pattern of behavior.
Because nearly all virtues are done for the sake of other virtues, we can represent virtues as a two-dimensional node graph.
The user constructs these virtue trees, assigns initial weights, and then begins recording the consequences of activities.

Virtuous Hummingbird will then learn which virtues the user values the most and present a set of activities that best reflect the virtue tree.
In essence, Virtuous Hummingbird is a form of machine learning applied to task prioritization with an element of deliberation.
By combining hard work and automation, task prioritization is easy.

\subsection{Competing and Comparable Products}

The products that offer the closest functionality to Virtuous Hummingbird are task trackers.
Task trackers expand on the basic task-list with features such as categories, tags, and prioritization.
Their primary advantage is their simplicity of use.
Lists are very simple to create, edit, and view.
Their primary disadvantage is their difficulty in scaling as the number and variety of tasks grows.
Task-trackers attempt to mitigate their scaling problems with organization tools, requiring at least a little planning.
There are several popular task-trackers available as of January 2021:

\begin{description}
    \item[Google Tasks], free.
    A widely used product on account of it being bundled with the standard apps for a Google account.
    It provides the ability to create sub-tasks, set due dates, and send notifications.
    It integrates with other Google apps, namely Gmail and Google Calendar.
    \item[Microsoft To Do], from \$5 per user per month.
    This product appears to offer similar features to Google Tasks.
    \item[Remember The Milk], free or \$40 per year.
    A simple task-list service with a focus on everyday, non-business application.
    Features an advanced auto-complete feature that makes creating tasks convenient.
    It can use e-mail, text, Twitter, and other apps.
    It can connect files from Google Drive and Dropbox to tasks.
    It features a smart search feature and priority system.
    \item[Trello], free to \$17.5 per user per month.
    A professional-focused task tracker.
    Based around dividing tasks into teams.
    These tasks can be detailed with comments, attachments, and due dates, and then viewed with an sophisticated interface.
    Programming and automation is available to streamline that process as well.
    \item[Todoist], free to \$5 per user per month.
    A task-tracker with many interesting features.
    It's core feature are well-detailed tasks.
    It also allows collaboration on tasks, including delegation and comments.
    Gamification is present as well, with a karma system and productivity visualizations.
    \item[Asana], free to per contract pricing.
    A feature-risk task-tracker with many different ways of viewing a task list, including a time-line view, a table view, a multi-list view, etc.
    It also features programming / automation to streamline task creation and management.
\end{description}

Another class of products to consider are time-tracking apps.
Rather than planning an activity in advance, time-tracking apps record an activity as it occurs.
They often have similar features to task-trackers, as well as billing, export, and retrospective editing features.
There are several popular time-tracking apps, as of January 2021:

\begin{description}
    \item[Toggl Track], free or \$9 per user per month.
    An easy-to-use tracking app.
    Activities can be tracked with or without a name, project, or tags, and then edited later.
    It also integrates very well with Google apps and works on many different platforms.
    \item[Harvest], free or \$12 per user per month.
    A team focused time-tracker.
    Teams can connect their logs to an administration log.
    It can also integrate well with task-trackers and other apps.
    \item[Everhour], free or \$5 per user per month.
    A light-weight time-tracker.
    It integrates well with other productivity apps and offers employee integration.
\end{description}

Calendar applications often provide very simple versions of the functionality mentioned above.
Full capability is provided only in conjunction with the above apps.
