\section{Introduction}

Virtuous Hummingbird is a program for the organization and advancement of personal virtue.
By virtue, we mean the virtues of virtue ethics, personal qualities indicating a pattern of repeated behavior.
These qualities are related causally to form a hierarchical tree of virtues. 
The simple nature of virtues and virtue trees makes virtue ethics an unusually intuitive and practical ethical theory.
By presenting a way to create, edit, visualize, and track these virtues, Virtuous Hummingbird facilitates living a virtuous life.

\section{Business Requirements}
\setreqtype{Business}{business}

\subsection{Prototyping}

\begin{requirement}[Prototyping \\ 1\textsuperscript{st} Priority]{1}
    Because there are no analogous programs, the inherent risk to this project is the possiblity that it's ideas have no merit.
    Therefore, this version of Virtuous Hummingbird will serve as a prototype.
    There \textit{are} many commercial productivity applications that have found widespread success, and these applications can and should provide inspiration and guidance.
    However, Virtuous Hummingbird is \textit{ethically} focused, and is more complex.
    This complexity demands multiple approaches and experimentation.
\end{requirement}

\subsection{Portfolio}

\begin{requirement}[Portfolio \\ 2\textsuperscript{nd} Priority]{2}
    Virtuous Hummingbird should serve as a programming portfolio piece.
    By selecting a modern language and modern tooling (presently Java 8 and Gradle), Virtuous Hummingbird can show competence in a modern development environment.
    By choosing a waterfall development process, we can demonstrate a product development process befitting a corporate environment.
\end{requirement}
 
\subsection{Personal Improvement}

\begin{requirement}[Personal Improvement \\ 3\textsuperscript{rd} Priority]{3}
    Virtuous Hummingbird is likely too simple to be a truly effective tool of virtue, but this development process can help explore the nuances of the underlying ethical theory.
    Ethical theories appear to be developed akin to science or engineering, not mathematics or art.
    Ethical theories require a cycle of constant iteration and improvement, and benefit more from trickery than logic or heart.
    With this view in mind, this developent process can provide tools to live ethically, even if Virtuous Hummingbird itself fails.
\end{requirement}

\section{Market Assessment}

\subsection{Target Demographic}

The target demographic is between 25 and 35 years of age.
This age group has the maturity to recognize the value of an ethical system, and enough time to reap the benefits of a full implementation.

The target demographic is male, because young men appear to take greater risks and have less of a sense of purpose in life.
The downsides of generally greater risk taking can be best mitigated by carefully selecting which risks have the highest return on investment, a task any ethical theory can help with.
Virtue ethics in particular favors long-term develop of the virtues, and therefore uniquely discourages short-term risk-taking.

The target demographic should also be educated, with at least some college, but preferably a bachelor's degree.
Virtue ethics works best when applied to a varied and numerous set of decisions, because their sheer potential complexity requires a deliberately simple approach.
College-educated users manage intellectually challenging classes and/or jobs, which therefore requires managing a varied and numerous set of decisions.

The target demographic is unmarried and without dependents, and preferably single.
As a consequence they will spend less time on relationships that will likely not benefit from ethical theory.

The target demographic values an individualistic approach to life and a Protestant work ethic.
Individualism is the principle that one ought to be independent and self-reliant, which encourages self-directed learning.
The Protestant work ethic is the belief that work, discipline, and frugality are a divine obligation.
A Protestant work ethic requires the hard work needed to make use of virtue ethics.

\subsection{Target Problem}

Our target demographic will likely have problems efficiently managing their time.
In many cases, a combination of a calendar, task-list, and time-tracker can help plan, prioritize, and track their activities.
As the the number and variety of activities increases, however, optimally prioritizing them becomes more difficult.
Virtue ethics can help this problem by offering a long-term, continuous, and simple method of organization.

First, these activities must be integrated into a tree of virtues.
A virtue is a trait with an associated pattern of behavior.
Because nearly all virtues are done for the sake of other virtues, we can represent virtues as a two-dimensional node graph.
The user constructs these virtue trees, assigns initial weights, and then begins recording the consequences of activities.

Virtuous Hummingbird will then learn which virtues the user values the most and present a set of activities that best reflect the virtue tree.
In essence, Virtuous Hummingbird is a form of machine learning applied to task prioritization with an element of deliberation.
By combining hard work and automation, task prioritization is easy.

\subsection{Competing and Comparable Products}

The products that offer the closest functionality to Virtuous Hummingbird are task trackers.
Task trackers expand on the basic task-list with features such as categories, tags, and prioritization.
Their primary advantage is their simplicity of use.
Lists are very simple to create, edit, and view.
Their primary disadvantage is their difficulty in scaling as the number and variety of tasks grows.
Task-trackers attempt to mitigate their scaling problems with organization tools, requiring at least a little planning.
There are several popular task-trackers available as of January 2021:

\begin{description}
    \item[Google Tasks], free.
    A widely used product on account of it being bundled with the standard apps for a Google account.
    It provides the ability to create sub-tasks, set due dates, and send notifications.
    It integrates with other Google apps, namely Gmail and Google Calendar.
    \item[Microsoft To Do], from \$5 per user per month.
    This product appears to offer similar features to Google Tasks.
    \item[Remember The Milk], free or \$40 per year.
    A simple task-list service with a focus on everyday, non-business application.
    Features an advanced auto-complete feature that makes creating tasks convenient.
    It can use e-mail, text, Twitter, and other apps.
    It can connect files from Google Drive and Dropbox to tasks.
    It features a smart search feature and priority system.
    \item[Trello], free to \$17.5 per user per month.
    A professional-focused task tracker.
    Based around dividing tasks into teams.
    These tasks can be detailed with comments, attachments, and due dates, and then viewed with an sophisticated interface.
    Programming and automation is available to streamline that process as well.
    \item[Todoist], free to \$5 per user per month.
    A task-tracker with many interesting features.
    It's core feature are well-detailed tasks.
    It also allows collaboration on tasks, including delegation and comments.
    Gamification is present as well, with a karma system and productivity visualizations.
    \item[Asana], free to per contract pricing.
    A feature-risk task-tracker with many different ways of viewing a task list, including a time-line view, a table view, a multi-list view, etc.
    It also features programming / automation to streamline task creation and management.
\end{description}

Another class of products to consider are time-tracking apps.
Rather than planning an activity in advance, time-tracking apps record an activity as it occurs.
They often have similar features to task-trackers, as well as billing, export, and retrospective editing features.
There are several popular time-tracking apps, as of January 2021:

\begin{description}
    \item[Toggl Track], free or \$9 per user per month.
    An easy-to-use tracking app.
    Activities can be tracked with or without a name, project, or tags, and then edited later.
    It also integrates very well with Google apps and works on many different platforms.
    \item[Harvest], free or \$12 per user per month.
    A team focused time-tracker.
    Teams can connect their logs to an administration log.
    It can also integrate well with task-trackers and other apps.
    \item[Everhour], free or \$5 per user per month.
    A light-weight time-tracker.
    It integrates well with other productivity apps and offers employee integration.
\end{description}

Calendar applications often provide very simple versions of the functionality mentioned above.
Full capability is provided only in conjunction with the above apps.
