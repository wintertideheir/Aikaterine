## Introduction

Virtuous Hummingbird is a program for the organization and advancement of personal virtue.
By virtue, we mean the virtues of virtue ethics, personal qualities indicating a pattern of repeated behavior.
These qualities are related causally to form a hierarchical tree of virtues. 
The simple nature of virtues and virtue trees makes virtue ethics an unusually intuitive and practical ethical theory.
By presenting a way to create, edit, visualize, and track these virtues, Virtuous Hummingbird facilitates living a virtuous life.

## Market Assessment

### Target Demographic

The target demographic is between 25 and 35 years of age.
This age group has the maturity to recognize the value of an ethical system, and enough time to reap the benefits of a full implementation.

The target demographic is male, because young men appear to take greater risks and have less of a sense of purpose in life.
The downsides of generally greater risk taking can be best mitigated by carefully selecting which risks have the highest return on investment, a task any ethical theory can help with.
Virtue ethics in particular favors long-term develop of the virtues, and therefore uniquely discourages short-term risk-taking.

The target demographic should also be educated, with at least some college, but preferably a bachelor's degree.
Virtue ethics works best when applied to a varied and numerous set of decisions, because their sheer potential complexity requires a deliberately simple approach.
College-educated users manage intellectually challenging classes and/or jobs, which therefore requires managing a varied and numerous set of decisions.

The target demographic is unmarried and without dependents, and preferably single.
As a consequence they will spend less time on relationships that will likely not benefit from ethical theory.

The target demographic values an individualistic approach to life and a Protestant work ethic.
Individualism is the principle that one ought to be independent and self-reliant, which encourages self-directed learning.
The Protestant work ethic is the belief that work, discipline, and frugality are a divine obligation.
A Protestant work ethic requires the hard work needed to make use of virtue ethics.

### Target Use Cases

Our target demographic will likely have problems efficiently managing their time.
In many cases, a combination of a calendar, task-list, and time-tracker can help plan, prioritize, and track their activities.
As the the number and variety of activities increases, however, optimally prioritizing them becomes more difficult.
Virtue ethics can help this problem by offering a long-term, continuous, and simple method of organization.

First, these activities must be integrated into a tree of virtues.
A virtue is a trait with an associated pattern of behavior.
Because nearly all virtues are done for the sake of other virtues, we can represent virtues as a two-dimensional node graph.
The user constructs these virtue trees, assigns initial weights, and then begins recording the consequences of activities.

Virtuous Hummingbird will then learn which virtues the user values the most and present a set of activities that best reflect the virtue tree.
In essence, Virtuous Hummingbird is a form of machine learning applied to task prioritization with an element of deliberation.
By combining hard work and automation, task prioritization is easy.
