\maketitle

\name{} is a program for the organization and advancement of personal virtue.
By virtue, we mean the virtues of virtue ethics, personal qualities indicating a pattern of repeated behavior.
These qualities are related causally to form a hierarchical tree of virtues. 
The simple nature of virtues and virtue trees makes virtue ethics an unusually intuitive and practical ethical theory.
By presenting a way to create, edit, visualize, and track these virtues, \name{} facilitates living a virtuous life.
