# Aikaterine

Aikaterine is an architecture for the organization and advancement of virtue.

## What is Aikaterine?

Aikaterine is a program that helps users live a virtuous life.
By virtue, we refer to virtues in _Eudaimonist_ virtue theory, a trait that contributes to human happiness or well-being.
Virtue ethics was chosen because it is more practical and easier to understand than others.
Eudaimonist virtue theory in particular views these virtues as a hierarchical tree, a very intuitive and well understood data structure.

We do not prescribe any particular set of virtues, except for the root virtue of the virtue tree, eudaimonia.
Eudaimonia, roughly translated as happiness or well-being, is far too central to eudaimonist virtue theory and too convenient to be optional.
Users may construct the virtue tree according to their personal wishes.

After construction, Aikaterine will calculate which virtues to prioritize.
The tasks associated with improving these particular virtues is then assigned to the user.
After the user completes these tasks, their performance is recorded and their list of tasks updated.
The algorithm should be highly configurable to the user's specific wants and needs.

## Aikaterine as a MVP

Aikaterine is currently in the minimum-viable-product (MVP) stage.
This project is written in Java, and we intend to rewrite it in a language with formal verification.

## Why Aikaterine?

Saint Katherine of Alexandria is the legend of a Christian martyr, possibly derived from the story of the pagan Hypatia of Alexandria.
Katherine is derived from the Greek _Aikaterine_, which in turn has several possible etymologies.
Our favorite theory is that Aikaterine is derived from Greek for suffering and torture, _aikia_.
The name is intended to invoke a Protestant work ethic.

Unfortunately, it appears that Aikaterine is a common name in Greece.
This name therefore violates an important rule of naming programming projects, which states that no programmer shall give their program women's names.
We are planning to rename this project in the near future.
