## What is the Waterfall Model?

The waterfall model of project management and software development describes the creation of a final product through sequential stages.
The five stages of the waterfall model, as originally presented by Herbert D. Benington, are

1. __Requirements__:
    1. __System Requirements__: Create a product requirements document.
    2. __Analysis__: Perform analysis to validate and elaborate on the requirements document.
2. __Design__: Describe the software architecture best suited to meet the requirements.
3. __Implementation__: Code and test the software.
4. __Verification__: Test the software to ensure it reliably and efficiently meets the requirements.
5. __Maintenance__: Install, update, and maintain the software.

The primary benefit of the waterfall model is that it's simplicity and rigor enables rapid development of good design while remaining accessible to new contributors.
